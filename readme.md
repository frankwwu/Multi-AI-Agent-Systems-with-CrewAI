# Multi AI Agent Systems with crewAI

Automate business workflows with multi-AI agent systems.

* Exceed the performance of prompting a single LLM by designing and prompting a team of AI agents through natural language.
* Use an open source library, crewAI, to automate repeatable, multi-step tasks like tailoring a resume to a job description; and automate business processes that are typically done by a group of people, like event planning.
* By creating a team of AI agents, you can define a specific role, goal, and backstory for each agent, which breaks down complex multi-step tasks and assigns them to agents that are customized to perform those tasks.

Prerequisite recommendation: If you've taken some prompt engineering courses, have some familiarity with basic coding, and want to incorporate LLMs in your professional work, then this course is designed for you!

## What you’ll learn in this course

Learn key principles of designing effective AI agents, and organizing a team of AI agents to perform complex, multi-step tasks. Apply these concepts to automate 6 common business processes.

Learn from João Moura, founder and CEO of crewAI, and explore key components of multi-agent systems: 

* __Role-playing__: Assign specialized roles to agents 
* __Memory__: Provide agents with short-term, long-term, and shared memory
* __Toolsv:__ Assign pre-built and custom tools to each agent (e.g. for web search)
* __Focus__: Break down the tasks, goals, and tools and assign to multiple AI agents for better performance
* __Guardrails__: Effectively handle errors, hallucinations, and infinite loops
* __Cooperation__: Perform tasks in series, in parallel, and hierarchically

Throughout the course, you'll work with crewAI, an open source library designed for building multi-agent systems. You'll learn to build agent crews that execute common business processes, such as:

* Tailor resumes and interview prep for job applications
* Research, write and edit technical articles
* Automate customer support inquiries
* Conduct customer outreach campaigns
* Plan and execute events
* Perform financial analysis

By the end of the course, you will have designed several multi-agent systems to assist you in common business processes, and also studied the key principles of AI agent systems.

      "- Use technical indicators such as RSI and Stochastic Oscillator to confirm overbought or oversold conditions.\n",

      "- Implement risk management techniques such as setting stop-loss orders on options positions to limit potential losses.\n",

      "- Monitor sector performance and economic indicators to identify potential opportunities for sector rotation.\n",
